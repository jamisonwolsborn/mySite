<p>I am a student at Portland State University studying Environmental Physics. I also do research building low-cost CO2 sensors and developing machine learning models to analyze urban CO2 concentrations. Professionally I want to use my skills as a programmer and researcher to go into Data Science and create data driven solutions to interesting problems.</p>

<p>While I primarily spend my time doing research or school work, a good portion of my time is dedicated to developing machine learning models and other Data Science tasks. When I have free time I love spending time outdoors going on hikes, backpacking trips, and climbing mountains.</p>

<p>I believe I will excel in any Data Science position because of my passion for the work, my background using quantitative methods, and ability to communicate effectively with people. While I still have a lot to learn, I am certain that given the opportunity I will be a valuable asset for any institution willing to bring me aboard.</p>

<p>I will graduate in December 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Physics but I plan on eventually going to grad school to obtain a PhD or Masters in Data Science.</p>
